# Problem Set 2 - GUI Application with FXML

Write an application that can accept an order to make a sub, out of three constituents: meat, cheese, and toppings. (There aren't any choices of bread.)

Use checkboxes to select (or unselect) kinds of meat (e.g. turkey, ham, roast beef, etc.), and kinds of toppings (e.g. lettuce, tomato, olives, etc.)

Use a combo box to select one kind of cheese out of at least 3 options (e.g. swiss, american, provolone, etc.)

When the user confirms the order (via a button), display a message in a textarea (non-editable), listing the ingredients that went into the sub.

Make a package for the view (fxml + controller), and another package for the main app driver code.
